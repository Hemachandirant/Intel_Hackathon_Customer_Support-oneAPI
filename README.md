## Brief of the Prototype

### Description
ByteZen is working on a groundbreaking solution for Customer IT Technical Support using a Large Language Model. The application leverages Intel's analytical toolkit and Cloud CPU to design and fine-tune AI models capable of understanding complex technical issues and providing prompt solutions. The toolkit includes the Intel Distribution of Modin for efficient data preprocessing, Intel Xeon CPUs coupled with Intel Extension for Transformers, and the Neural Compressor for model quantization.

### Goal
The goal of ByteZen is to revolutionize technical support by building an AI-powered application that offers round-the-clock assistance. The application aims to provide instant solutions to customer problems, reducing downtime and enhancing the overall user experience.

### Prototype Description
The prototype utilizes Huggingface Transformers with large language models, including Mistral-7B and LLava-13B. Technologies such as Intel Extension for transformers, Intel Analytical Toolkit, Intel Neural Compressor, Intel Distribution for Python, streamlit, Langchain, node.js (Avatar Application), Azure Speech Service, and Ngrok are employed to achieve the project goals.
